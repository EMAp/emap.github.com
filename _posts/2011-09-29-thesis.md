================

Description Logics (DLs) is a family of formalisms used to represent
knowledge of a domain. They are equipped with a formal logic-based
semantics. Knowledge representation systems based on description
logics provide various inference capabilities that deduce implicit
knowledge from the explicitly represented knowledge. In this thesis we
investigate the Proof Theory for DLs. We introduce Sequent Calculi and
Natural Deduction for some DLs (ALC, ALCQ). Cut-elimination and
Normalization are proved for the calculi. It is argued that those
systems can improve the extraction of computational content from DLs
proofs for explanations purpose.
