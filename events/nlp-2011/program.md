<b>Introduction to Text Mining</b>, Gerard de Melo<br/><br/>

This talk will introduce some popular techniques used to process and
organize text document collections.  Along the way, some of the most
elementary natural language processing ingredients will be discussed,
including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop word
removal. We will then present the Vector Space Model and describe how
it can be used 1) to assess how similar two documents are, 2) to
categorize documents based on their contents, and 3) to cluster
similar documents into groups. Finally, we will also point out how
this model is used for information retrieval and web search.

<b>Web Mining with Advanced Text Representations</b>, Gerard de Melo<br/><br/>

This talk will build on the Introduction to Text Mining and will
discuss how language resources can allow us to construct more
sophisticated text representations. Such advanced text representations
are particularly useful when organizing information on the Web. For
instance, we will discuss how user attitudes towards products can be
extracted from blogs using sentiment mining techniques. We will also
describe in great detail how language resources can be used to extend
text mining to work with very short pieces of text (e.g. Twitter
posts) and with multilingual text collections.

<b>Information Extraction and Large-Scale Knowledge Bases</b>, Gerard de Melo<br/><br/>

This talk will describe methods that are used to extract knowledge
from text. We start out with important natural language processing
techniques like named entity recognition and coreference resolution,
which help us identify what people and objects a given sentence is
talking about. We then cover pattern-based information extraction
techniques that allow us to extract facts abouts such objects from a
text collection. Finally, we describe some of the more recent
large-scale knowledge bases that provide large numbers of facts about
the world.
