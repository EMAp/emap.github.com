<b>Introduction to Text Mining</b>
<br/>Gerard de Melo<br/><br/>

This talk will introduce some popular techniques used to process and
organize text document collections.  Along the way, some of the most
elementary natural language processing ingredients will be discussed,
including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop word
removal. We will then present the Vector Space Model and describe how
it can be used 1) to assess how similar two documents are, 2) to
categorize documents based on their contents, and 3) to cluster
similar documents into groups. Finally, we will also point out how
this model is used for information retrieval and web search.

<b>Introducing SUMO the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology</b><br/>
Valeria de Paiva, Rearden Commerce, CA<br/>

<p>This talk presents an overview of ontology creation and development
in <a href="http://www.ontologyportal.org">SUMO</a>, including how we
envisage using it to help with reasoning about Portuguese texts.</p>

<p>The Suggested Upper Merged Ontology will be introduced (no previous
knowledge assumed) and Sigma (the ontology environment) associated
with it will be demonstrated.  Issues of the capabilities and
tradeoffs in first order logic inference are briefly explored.  The
SUMO mappings to the WordNet lexicon are also discussed.</p>

<p>Hopefully some hands-on axiom writing will be done together, bring
your laptops!</p>

<b>Graph-Based Methods for Multilingual Knowledge about Words and Entities</b><br/>
Gerard de Melo<br/><br/>

An increasing number of applications are making use of explicit
knowledge about words and the entities they represent. This talk
presents three graph-based data integration techniques to obtain such
knowledge. The first involves learning models to connect words to
their meanings. The second reconciles equivalence and distinctness
information about entities from multiple sources. The third method
adds a comprehensive taxonomic hierarchy, reflecting how different
entities relate to each other. Together, they can be used to produce a
large-scale multilingual knowledge base semantically describing over 5
million entities and over 16 million natural language words and names
in more than 200 different languages.

<b>A Semantic-Inferentialist Model for Natural Language Processing</b><br/>
Vládia Pinheiro<br/><br/>

The information necessary for a complete understanding of texts in
natural language is sometimes implicit, which requires drawing
inferences from the use of concepts in the linguistic praxis. We claim
that it is within the linguistic practice that the circumstances to
use a word and the consequences thereof can be grasped, and – by
disregarding them – much of what could be inferred is lost. In this
paper, we present a computational model to treat the
semantic-pragmatic level of natural languages – the Semantic
Inferentialism Model (SIM). The semantic knowledge bases, the
inferential relatedness measure and the inferential reasoning of SIM
are detailed. SIM was used in the development of WikiCrimesIE – an
application for extracting information about crime reported in news
reports. Information related to the type of crime, causes of crime and
type of weapon were implicit in most of the texts analyzed and the
results of WikiCrimesIE demonstrate the feasibility and the
differential of using SIM in natural language understanding systems.

<b>Web Mining with Advanced Text Representations</b>
<br/>Gerard de Melo<br/><br/>

This talk will build on the Introduction to Text Mining and will
discuss how language resources can allow us to construct more
sophisticated text representations. Such advanced text representations
are particularly useful when organizing information on the Web. For
instance, we will discuss how user attitudes towards products can be
extracted from blogs using sentiment mining techniques. We will also
describe in great detail how language resources can be used to extend
text mining to work with very short pieces of text (e.g. Twitter
posts) and with multilingual text collections.

<b>Contexts for Quantification</b><br/>
Valeria de Paiva, Rearden Commerce, CA<br/>

<p>Logical systems conceived for providing semantics and logical forms
for sentences of English abound. From Montague's original Higher-order
Intensional Logic in the seventies, to Situation Theory and Discourse
Representation Theory as well as the  several frame languages (e.g.
KL-ONE) and their descendents, the  Description Logics  in the 80's
and 90's, to vanilla versions of First-order logic (FOL) with bells
and whistles more recently, the field is rife with possibilities and
issues.</p>

<p>I want to describe one more such language, the product of several
years of development of the NLP-based knowledge representation system
Bridge, at PARC. While the design of the language was historically
tied-up to the development of the software system, I believe that the
language and its inferential system are of independent interest. In
previous publications, we have been calling this logic language TIL,
for Textual Inference Logic. TIL can be considered one of several
systems associated with Natural Logic.</p>

<p>Within the traditions of Natural logic, TIL distinguishes itself by
the unorthodox treatment of quantification in terms of instantiation
of concepts within  contexts. I want to describe this mechanism of
quantification, necessitated by what we consider a better modelling of
negation and other intensional phenomena, ubiquitous in natural
language. Further we want  to map and  relate TIL's expressive power
to that of more traditional systems, as for example, the ones
described by Moss.</p>

<b>A wide-coverage free/open-source deep parser for Brazilian
Portuguese: a work in progress</b><br/>
<a href="http://www.leonel.profusehost.net/complin.htm">Leonel Figueiredo de Alencar</a><br/>
Research Group on Language and Computation, UFC<br/><br/>

Aiming at reducing the shortage of freely distributed resources for
the computational processing of Portuguese, we report on an ongoing
project of a X-bar theory based parser for a wide range of texts in
the Brazilian variety. In this talk we focus on the first stage of the
project, which mainly resulted in the Aelius and Donatus modules. The
former is a tool for morpho-syntactic tagging which features
stochastic and hybrid taggers in three different architectures and
also provides a user-friendly interface for third-party taggers. The
latter is an interface between Aelius and NLTK's context-free grammar
parsers. Therefore, Donatus performs deep parsing of text only
resorting to a formalization of phrase structure rules, dispensing
with the compilation of lexical entries or the implementation of a
morphological lexical analyzer. The current phase of the project
consists in developing a nominal expression chunker to be integrated
into Aelius, and in implementing, by means of Donatus, a parser for a
comprehensive grammar of DPs, taking as its starting point existing
generative descriptions of Brazilian Portuguese.

<b>Information Extraction and Large-Scale Knowledge Bases</b>
<br/>Gerard de Melo<br/><br/>

This talk will describe methods that are used to extract knowledge
from text. We start out with important natural language processing
techniques like named entity recognition and coreference resolution,
which help us identify what people and objects a given sentence is
talking about. We then cover pattern-based information extraction
techniques that allow us to extract facts abouts such objects from a
text collection. Finally, we describe some of the more recent
large-scale knowledge bases that provide large numbers of facts about
the world.

<b>Localizing Math</b><br/>
Isabel Cafezeiro and Ivan da Costa Marques<br/><br/>

We start from the analysis of Turing's work in On computable numbers,
with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem raising evidences
about how he proceeded to build the definition of computability.
Taking advantage of his stepwise construction that starts from the
materialities to achieve a satisfactory level of abstraction, we show
how his way of doing mathematic fits an approach of knowledge
construction where there is not definite  separation between materia
and form, and thus, the world and the language are not closed spheres.
In the same line of reasoning,  the abstract and the concrete, the
deduction and the induction, the technical and the social, the
objective and the subjective are unthinkable as pure entities.
Considering controversies and discussions from the mid-nineteenth
century to nowadays, we verify a social component that permanently
takes part in what is usually considered "technical content" or
“objectivity” undermining, thus, the axis of authority of mathematics,
logic and computing. Under this view new possibilities for knowledge
construction are acknowledged, allowing maths that are done and lived
outside the major centers.

<b>History of logic and language crisis in representation of scientific knowledge</b><br/>
Diego Munk London, COPPE-UFRJ<br/><br/>

The main hypothesis proposed by this work is the idea that as long as
the catalogs of experimental data of each specific science expand, as
a consequence of time, experience and technical advances, the specific
formal languages used for the confection of their models exhaust their
ability to increase semantic elasticity and force the scientist to
give up on significant portions of their base of knowledge. This fact
leads logicians and science philosophers to investigate the nature of
formal languages and the origins and possible solutions to this
crisis.

<b>Intuitionistic Description Logic and Legal Reasoning</b><br/>
<a href="http://www-di.inf.puc-rio.br/~hermann/">Edward Hermann</a>, DI/PUC-Rio<br/><br/>

Classical Logic has been frequently used as a basis for knowledge
representation and reasoning in many specific domains.  Legal
Knowledge Representation is particularly interesting due to the
natural occurrences of conflicts among law systems, individual laws
and cases. Those conflicts are usually taken as logical
inconsistencies. Due to its inherently normative feature, coherence
(consistency) in legal ontologies is more subtle than in most other
domains. An adequate intuitionistic semantics for negation in a legal
domain comes to the fore when we take legally valid individual
statements as the inhabitants of our legal ontology. This allows us to
elegantly deal with particular situations of legal coherence, such as
conflict of laws, as those solved by Private International Law
analysis. In this talk: (1) Briefly presents our version of
Intuitionistic Description Logic, called IALC for Intuitionistic ALC;
(2) Shows a study on the logical coherence analysis of "Conflict of
Laws in Space", in the scope of Private International Law, by means of
the IALC Sequent Calculus proposed herein.

<b>On the Computational complexity of Intuitionistic Modal and Description Logics</b><br/>
<a href="http://www-di.inf.puc-rio.br/~hermann/">Edward Hermann</a>, DI/PUC-Rio<br/><br/>

In this talk we will present a proof of PSPACE completeness for the
satisfiability problem of Intuitionistic Modal Logic IK and
Intuitionistic Description Logic iALC. We propose a 2-person
game which can be polynomially implemented in an Alternating Turing
Machine, and which relates the existence of a winning strategy, for
one player, to the satisfiability of a given formula. It is
well-known that any polynomial time implementation on an Alternating
Turing Machine can be solved in an ordinary Turing Machine using
polynomial space. We also prove the finite model property for both
logics. This is achieved because if there exists a winning strategy
for a given formula then a finite model is built at the final stage
of the game.
