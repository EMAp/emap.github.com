<b>Introduction to Text Mining</b>
<br/>Gerard de Melo<br/><br/>

This talk will introduce some popular techniques used to process and
organize text document collections.  Along the way, some of the most
elementary natural language processing ingredients will be discussed,
including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop word
removal. We will then present the Vector Space Model and describe how
it can be used 1) to assess how similar two documents are, 2) to
categorize documents based on their contents, and 3) to cluster
similar documents into groups. Finally, we will also point out how
this model is used for information retrieval and web search.

<b>Introducing SUMO the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology</b><br/>
Valeria de Paiva<br/><br/>

<p>This talk presents an overview of ontology creation and development
in <a href="http://www.ontologyportal.org">SUMO</a>, including how we
envisage using it to help with reasoning about Portuguese texts.</p>

<p>The Suggested Upper Merged Ontology will be introduced (no previous
knowledge assumed) and Sigma (the ontology environment) associated
with it will be demonstrated.  Issues of the capabilities and
tradeoffs in first order logic inference are briefly explored.  The
SUMO mappings to the WordNet lexicon are also discussed.</p>

<p>Hopefully some hands-on axiom writing will be done together, bring
your laptops!</p>

<b>Web Mining with Advanced Text Representations</b>
<br/>Gerard de Melo<br/><br/>

This talk will build on the Introduction to Text Mining and will
discuss how language resources can allow us to construct more
sophisticated text representations. Such advanced text representations
are particularly useful when organizing information on the Web. For
instance, we will discuss how user attitudes towards products can be
extracted from blogs using sentiment mining techniques. We will also
describe in great detail how language resources can be used to extend
text mining to work with very short pieces of text (e.g. Twitter
posts) and with multilingual text collections.

<b>Information Extraction and Large-Scale Knowledge Bases</b>
<br/>Gerard de Melo<br/><br/>

This talk will describe methods that are used to extract knowledge
from text. We start out with important natural language processing
techniques like named entity recognition and coreference resolution,
which help us identify what people and objects a given sentence is
talking about. We then cover pattern-based information extraction
techniques that allow us to extract facts abouts such objects from a
text collection. Finally, we describe some of the more recent
large-scale knowledge bases that provide large numbers of facts about
the world.

<b>Localizing Math</b><br/>
Isabel Cafezeiro and Ivan da Costa Marques<br/><br/>

We start from the analysis of Turing's work in On computable numbers,
with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem raising evidences
about how he proceeded to build the definition of computability.
Taking advantage of his stepwise construction that starts from the
materialities to achieve a satisfactory level of abstraction, we show
how his way of doing mathematic fits an approach of knowledge
construction where there is not definite  separation between materia
and form, and thus, the world and the language are not closed spheres.
In the same line of reasoning,  the abstract and the concrete, the
deduction and the induction, the technical and the social, the
objective and the subjective are unthinkable as pure entities.
Considering controversies and discussions from the mid-nineteenth
century to nowadays, we verify a social component that permanently
takes part in what is usually considered "technical content" or
“objectivity” undermining, thus, the axis of authority of mathematics,
logic and computing. Under this view new possibilities for knowledge
construction are acknowledged, allowing maths that are done and lived
outside the major centers.

<b>Intuitionistic Description Logic and Legal Reasoning</b>
<br/>Edward Hermann<br/><br/>

Classical Logic has been frequently used as a basis for knowledge
representation and reasoning in many specific domains.  Legal
Knowledge Representation is particularly interesting due to the
natural occurrences of conflicts among law systems, individual laws
and cases. Those conflicts are usually taken as logical
inconsistencies. Due to its inherently normative feature, coherence
(consistency) in legal ontologies is more subtle than in most other
domains. An adequate intuitionistic semantics for negation in a legal
domain comes to the fore when we take legally valid individual
statements as the inhabitants of our legal ontology. This allows us to
elegantly deal with particular situations of legal coherence, such as
conflict of laws, as those solved by Private International Law
analysis. In this talk: (1) Briefly presents our version of
Intuitionistic Description Logic, called IALC for Intuitionistic ALC;
(2) Shows a study on the logical coherence analysis of "Conflict of
Laws in Space", in the scope of Private International Law, by means of
the IALC Sequent Calculus proposed herein.

<b>On the Computational complexity of Intuitionistic Modal and
Description Logics</b>
<br/>
Edward Hermann<br/><br/>

In this talk we will present a proof of PSPACE completeness for the
satisfiability problem of Intuitionistic Modal Logic IK and
Intuitionistic Description Logic iALC. We propose a 2-person
game which can be polynomially implemented in an Alternating Turing
Machine, and which relates the existence of a winning strategy, for
one player, to the satisfiability of a given formula. It is
well-known that any polynomial time implementation on an Alternating
Turing Machine can be solved in an ordinary Turing Machine using
polynomial space. We also prove the finite model property for both
logics. This is achieved because if there exists a winning strategy
for a given formula then a finite model is built at the final stage
of the game.
