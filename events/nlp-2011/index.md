During Nov 20-25 of 2011, EMAp will host a metting about natural
language processing for portuguese language.

The plan consists of a minicourse of 5 days, 1:30 a day, some other
formal and informal discussions.

[Gerard de Melo](http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~demelo/) is our main
speaker, we intend to learn lots about YAGO and MENTA and his clever
methods to extract information from open sources like Wikipedia.

[Hermann Hausler](http://www-di.inf.puc-rio.br/~hermann/) might
talk about games for complexity bounds for intuitonistic description
logic iALC.

Izabel Cafezeiro will talk about the construction of mathematical
knowledge.

We hope Suemi will talk about the Dictionary of Historic Persons and
we will make progress on a plan for using ontologies to improve access
to it.

[Val√©ria de Paiva](https://sites.google.com/a/valeriadepaiva.org/www/)
shall introduce people to SUMO and Sigma and then hopefully talk about
"Natural Logic and Contexts for Quantification".

## News

- The program is still under construction. Unfortunately, Luiz Carlos
  is traveling and will not participate. Izabel Cafezeiro will present
  a very interesting topic of her research.
