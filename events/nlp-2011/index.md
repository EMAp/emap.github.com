[Gerard de Melo](http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~demelo/) is our main

methods to extract information from open sources like Wikipedia.

[Hermann Hausler](http://www-di.inf.puc-rio.br/~hermann/) might
talk about games for complexity bounds for intuitonistic description
logic iALC.

[Valéria de Paiva](https://sites.google.com/a/valeriadepaiva.org/www/)
shall introduce people to SUMO and Sigma and then hopefully talk about
"Natural Logic and Contexts for Quantification".

Isabel Cafezeiro will talk about the construction of mathematical
knowledge.

Suemi will talk about the Dictionary of Historic Persons and we will
make progress on a plan for using ontologies to improve access to it.
