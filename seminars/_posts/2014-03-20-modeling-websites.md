Driven by outstanding success stories of Internet startups such as
Facebook and The Huffington Post, recent studies have thoroughly
described their growth. These highly visible online success
stories,however, overshadow an untold number of similar ventures that
fail. The study of website popularity is ultimately incomplete without
general mechanisms that can describe both successes and failures. In
this talk, the speaker will present a model that is able to describe
website popularity and predict evolution over time. The model is
inspired by the writings of Nobel Laureate Herbert A. Simon. In a 1969
lecture Simon observed that many information systems were designed as
if information was scarce, when the problem is just the opposite. "A
wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to
allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of
information sources that might consume it." The model equations
consider Internet users'attention as a scarce resource that must be
"consumed" by a website. Users`interactions with the website also
create content that consumes the attention of other users. For
instance, if the attention we dedicate to Facebook incites us to
create content that helps Facebook capture a larger share of attention
of our friends, then our friends will also produce more content (on
average), which in turn captures a larger share of our attention. This
positive attention feedback loop drives Facebook user activity up. But
as the attention we are willing to dedicate to Facebook is limited,
our (average) activity eventually stabilizes and remains
stable. Conversely, if the share of our attention consumed by the
website is not able to drive enough attention and content creation
from our friends to keep our current attention level, then the
negative attention feedback drives the website to its death. This talk
is targeted to a diverse audience of undergraduate and graduate
students majoring in computer science, physics, economics, and the
social sciences.
