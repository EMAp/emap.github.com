Stochastic generalizations of moving boundary problems appear quite
naturally in the continuum description of e.g. solidification
problems. Perhaps the simplest example is provided by a so-called
one-sided solidification problem in which a condensed (solid)
non-diffusing phase grows at the expense of a diluted diffusing phase
(vapor or liquid). In this context, noise terms can be introduced to
account for fluctuations in the interface kinetics leading to
irreversible growth, and in the diffusive currents in the diluted
phase. Thus, an effective closed evolution equation for the interface
profile can be derived in a systematic way, carrying both
deterministic and stochastic contributions, with parameters that can
be related to those of the full moving boundary problem. This
effective equation provides an interesting instance in which one can
study the interplay between noise and non-local effects induced by
diffusive interactions. Going beyond the approximations made in this
process requires e.g. formulation of a (stochastic) phase-field
description that is equivalent to the original moving boundary
problem. In turn, phase-field simulations allow to explore the rich
morphological diagram that ensues. Applications will be discussed in
the context both of non-living and biological systems subject to
diffusion-limited growth, such as surfaces of thin films produced by
Chemical Vapor Deposition or by Electrochemical deposition, or
bacterial colonies.

## Biography

[Rodolfo Cuerno Rejado](http://matematicas.uc3m.es/index.php/dpto-people/titulares/rcuerno-menu)
graduated in Physics and obtained his PhD in Sciences from the
Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid. After this, he spent 2 years as a
postdoctoral researcher at the university of Boston, USA. Since 2000
he is titular professor at the Math department, Universidad Carlos III
(Madrid). His research interests include complex systems, in
particular statistical mechanics of interfacial phenomena and
applications. He is coordinator of the project
[MICINN](http://www.dynamint.org) about interface dynamics in solids,
fluids and biosystems.  For his research results in this area, he
received the UC3M Young Scientist Award, in 2011.
