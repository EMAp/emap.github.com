A pair of rooted tangents (equivalent to a triangle) is proposed as
the primitive to represent and study planar shapes. How "isosceles"
and how "degenerate" these triangles are correspond to the mirror and
parallel symmetry of such pairs. Symmetry values are accumulated in a
6-dimensional histogram. By marginalizing this histogram, we capture
geometric properties for a range of applications: detection of
nearly-circular cells; location of the reflection symmetry axis;
detection of cell-division in movies of developing embryos; detection
of worm-tips and indirect cell-counting. The corresponding algorithms
display state-of-the-art performance. We also consider a multilayer
geometric representation in which pairs of triangles are used to fit
multiple and overlapping ellipses. This work corresponds to
publications at CVPR 2014 and ICIP 2014.
