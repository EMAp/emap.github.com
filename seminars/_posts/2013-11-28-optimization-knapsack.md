A large variety of decision problems can be accurately modeled as
linear optimization problems that involve decisions that can be chosen
among discrete sets of possibilities (MILP). Moreover, decision makers
are usually facing several source of uncertainty which are translated
into uncertain parameters in the optimization models. A simplistic way
to handle these uncertainties is to overestimate the unknown
parameters. However, this results in wasting capital as well as
operational expenditures such as energy resources. In contrast to this
naive approach, researchers have introduced frameworks where the
uncertainty is directly taken into account either by considering
random variables as input (and optimizing expected costs) or in a
worst case approach where the uncertainty parameters are constrained
in a convex set. These frameworks are respectively denoted by
Stochastic Programming and Robust Optimization (RO).

In this talk, we will introduce these methodologies and describe how
they can be applied to the knapsack problem, a very important MILP. We
will then present some of our recent works and show how to solve
efficiently different versions of stochastic and robust knapsack
problems. Our results are both theoretical and empirical.

## Biography

Michael Poss graduated in Mathematics from the Université Libre de
Bruxelles (Belgium) and in Operational Research from the University of
Edinburgh (UK). He obtained his PhD in Operations Research from the
Université Libre de Bruxelles in February 2011, after which he spent a
couple of months at the Universidade de Aveiro (Portugal), followed by
a postdoctoral stay at the Universidade de Coimbra (Portugal). He is a
CNRS researcher at Heudiasyc since October 2012. His interests are in
Operations Research, and more particularly, Optimization under
Uncertainty.
