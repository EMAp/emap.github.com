Various systems in nature can be described by dynamical systems
coupled through a network structure, for example a network of neurons
or coupled oscillators. It is important to understand under which
conditions such networks synchronize, since in many applications
synchronization is a property that is either desired or undesirable
(e.g. in epilepsy attacks).

I will introduce a mathematical model for a network of identical
dynamical systems with a general "diffusion-like" coupling, i.e. a
coupling that pushes connected nodes to a common state. Our main
result is that when the coupling is sufficiently strong, then such a
network of nodes (with general dynamics) has a stable synchronized
state. Furthermore, our technique of using the dichotomy spectrum then
also implies that this persists, even when the nodes are not exactly
identical.

This is joint work with Tiago Pereira, Martin Rasmussen and Alexei
Veneziani.


## Palestrante

[Jaap Eldering](http://www.jaapeldering.nl/index.php) obtained his PhD
at Utrecht University, The Netherlands in 2012. After that, he was a
postdoc at Imperial College London, and since June 2015 he is a
visiting researcher at PUC-Rio.

His research interests are broadly in dynamical systems and
(geometric) mechanics. His PhD thesis was on normally hyperbolic
invariant manifolds (in particular, on extending persistence results
to noncompact manifolds in bounded geometry). Since then, he has
worked on various more applied problems, such as network
synchronization, biolocomotion, a particle model for fluid flow, and
nonholonomic dynamics.
