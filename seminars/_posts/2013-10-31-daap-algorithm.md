Large scale stochastic optimization problems are too difficult to be
solved directly numerically. One way of dealing with this type of
problems is to decompose the main problem in smaller one and
coordinate the solutions of each smaller problems. In a deterministic
setting spatial decomposition methods are well known but quite useless
if directly used in a stochastic setting. We present the Dual
Approximate Dynamic Programming algorithm which solve an approximation
of the original problem by decomposition. We will present the
algorithm, some thoughts and results about its convergence and
numerical application and results over an energy management problem.
