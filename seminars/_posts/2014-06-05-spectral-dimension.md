In this talk we discuss random trees and in particular trees with a
unique infinite spine which appear for example in critical
Galton-Watson processes, percolation clusters and biological models
related to RNA folding. Our main interest are two characteristics of
those random trees, their fractal dimension, defined through volume
growth, and their spectral dimension, defined through the return
probability of simple random walks on those trees. The former purely
depends on the volume while the latter is also sensitive on the
connectivity of the trees, giving for example a measure for
information spread on those random graphs. The main result is a
theorem for the values of the fractal and spectral dimension of a
large class of tress with a unique infinite spine which can be applied
to the above examples.
