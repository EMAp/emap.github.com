To date, almost all experimental evaluations of machine learning-based
recognition algorithms have taken the form of "closed set"
recognition, whereby all testing classes are known at training time. A
more realistic scenario for real-world applications is "open set"
recognition, where incomplete knowledge of the world is present at
training time, and unknown classes can be submitted to an algorithm
during testing. The first part of this talk introduces the problem of
open set recognition, and formalizes its definition as a constrained
minimization problem. The open set recognition problem is not well
addressed by existing algorithms because it requires strong
generalization. As a step towards a solution, the "1-vs-Set Machine"
algorithm is proposed, which sculpts a decision space from the
marginal distances of a 1-class or binary SVM with a linear
kernel. This methodology has been applied to several different
applications in computer vision where open set recognition is a
challenging problem, including object recognition and face
verification.

The second part of this talk looks at a different aspect of the open
set recognition problem related to stylometry in computational
linguistics. The quantification of style in any text cannot proceed in
isolation â€“ all texts must be examined in a broader context where even
unknown influences can place constraints upon an author. To address
this, a new feature set is introduced to capture sound and lexical
information. A learning methodology is then developed for the task of
open set influence recognition. The talk will examine a case study
related to philological evidence that an eighth century CE Latin poem
by Paul the Deacon was influenced by the works of the classical Roman
poet Catullus.

Professor Adjoint at the University of Colorado Colorado
Springs. Previously, he was the director of research & development at
Securics, Inc., an early stage company producing innovative computer
vision-based solutions. He received his Ph.D. from the University of
Colorado and his M.S. and B.A. degrees from Lehigh
University. Dr. Scheirer has extensive experience in the areas of
computer vision and human biometrics, with an emphasis on advanced
learning techniques. His overarching research interest is the
fundamental problem of recognition, including the representations and
algorithms supporting solutions to it.
