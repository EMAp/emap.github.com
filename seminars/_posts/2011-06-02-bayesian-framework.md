Mathematical models in biology are powerful tools for the study and
exploration of complex dynamics. Nevertheless, bringing theoretical
results to an agreement with experimental observations involves
acknowledging a great deal of uncertainty intrinsic to our theoretical
representation of a real system. Proper handling of such uncertainties
is key to the successful usage of models to predict experimental or
field observations. This problem has been addressed over the years by
many tools for model calibration and parameter estimation. In this
article we present a general framework for uncertainty analysis and
parameter estimation that is designed to handle uncertainties
associated with the modeling of dynamic biological systems while
remaining agnostic as to the type of model used. We apply the
framework to fit an SIR-like influenza transmission model to 7 years
of incidence data in three European countries: Belgium, the
Netherlands and Portugal.
