Never before in history data is generated and collected at such high
volumes as it is today. As the volumes of data available to business
people, scientists, and the public increase, their effective use
becomes more challenging. Keeping up to date with the flood of data,
using standard tools for data analysis and exploration, is fraught
with difficulty. The field of visual analytics seeks to provide people
with better and more effective ways to understand and analyze large
datasets, while also enabling them to act upon their findings
immediately. Visual analytics integrates the analytic capabilities of
the computer and the abilities of the human analyst, allowing novel
discoveries and empowering individuals to take control of the
analytical process. Visual analytics enables unexpected and hidden
insights, which may lead to beneficial and profitable innovation. The
talk presents the challenges of visual analytics and exemplifies them
with several application examples, which illustrate the exiting
potential of current visual analysis techniques but also their
limitations.
