This talk will discuss current research targeted at making 3D
documentation a practical alternative for Cultural Heritage
organisations, including the results of dissemination experiments
undertaken by the [3D-COFORM project](http://www.3d-coform.eu) in
collaboration with museums such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, The
Louvre, and L'Academia in Florence, as well as World Heritage sites
such as the temples at Abu Simbal in Egypt.

These experiments have reinforced the need for further research and
the talk will outline some future challenges in topics such as
searching 3D object repositories, connecting shape to metadata and the
interpretation of the semantics of shape. The talk will also describe
some of the challenges that the research faces in the quest to empower
the mass 3D digitisation and widespread dissemination, including
3D-COFORM's contribution to the introduction of the class of
"3D-objects" into the Europeana digital library. The challenges to
intellectual property presented by digitisation of Cultural Heritage,
authorship and re-use of digital assets in other contexts and
long-term preservation of digital assets will be outlined.
