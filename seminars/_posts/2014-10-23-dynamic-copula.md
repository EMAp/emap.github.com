The standard way of modelling several stochastic processes which are
not mutually independent is as correlated components of a Gaussian
process (that is, normally distributed). It is easy to generalize this
to elliptic processes with distributions like students t. There are
two problems with this approach: firstly, all the variables must have
the same marginal distribution and secondly, the correlation structure
(in the wide sense) is symmetrical in the upper and lower tails (left
figure below). But in reality, some variables are upper tail dependent
(or lower tail) as in right figure below.

Copulas were invented to provide a much wider range of "correlation"
structures between variables and to allow variables to have different
marginal distributions. While many bivariate copulas exist, it is more
difficult to construct multivariate ones, and it is even more
difficult to construct dynamic copula processes.

[This paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1616503)
presents a flexible family of copula-based multivariate models
designed for handling large numbers of variables (1) as random vectors
in the static case or (2) as vector stochastic processes in the
dynamic case. The family includes models with upper and lower tail
dependence. Variables need not be exchangeable. To illustrate the
model's potential; three radically different examples have been
constructed: a straight additive model, an additive conditional gamma
model and a switching model. Archimedean copulas turn out to be a
special case of the general model. Another advantage of these models
it that it is easy to construct dynamic versions of the static
copulas. Lastly, as these models are defined in a conditional
independence framework, they are easy to simulate.
