Simulators, also known as computer models, are mathematical
representations of a real system implemented in a computer. Simulators
are often su ciently complex that they take appreciable amounts of
computer time or other resources to run. In this context, a
methodology has been developed based on building a statistical
representation of the simulator, known as an emulator. The principal
approach to building emulators uses Gaussian processes. I am going to
present a Gaussian process emulator as surrogate for the
simulator. Also extensions will be presented and illustrated in some
toy examples.
