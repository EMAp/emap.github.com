Some mature ﬁndings in person recognition research restrict their use
cases for dealing with near frontal face poses under controlled
environments conditions. Such special pose and environment conditions
can be accepted if imposed as requirement for security applications,
but they are not reasonable constraints when dealing with personal
collections. In this paper is proposed a person recognition approach
designed for aiding the task of personal collections tagging under
non-controlled conditions. It can be generally described as a
collection-aware clustering approach, that evaluates people appearance
across the photo set. A classiﬁcatory procedure working over a trained
Kohonen network is proposed. The network is responsible for learning
people appearance working over a dynamically reduced feature space.
