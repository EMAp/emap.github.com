More than forty years ago, U.S. government officials already felt
overwhelmed by the amount of information gathered by the vast
apparatus of the national security state. Beguiled by the promise of
harnessing all of it for data-driven analysis, the State Department
became an early-adopter of electronic record-keeping. It quickly lost
tens of thousands of documents in the transition. Vastly more
information was purposefully deleted decades later, when crude forms
of statistical sampling led officials to delete whole classes of
records on everything from passports and visas to cultural diplomacy
and international sport. Since all governments will eventually face
the same problem, exploring the archive of the U.S. State Department -
or what's left of it - indicates the kinds of challenges researchers
will face when more and more history leaves no paper trail. It also
shows how important it will be to develop new and better computational
methods for analyzing these large corporae of textual records.
