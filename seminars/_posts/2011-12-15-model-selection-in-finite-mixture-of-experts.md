We consider the estimation of the number of components on a
mixture-of-experts (ME) model, using penalized maximum likelihood. We
show that, under mild conditions on the mixture densities, a large
class of penalization criteria enjoy the consistency property. This
wide class of methods encompasses the Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC), which is the most frequently used method in the ME
literature. We close the paper with a few examples of densities and
penalty functions satisfying the assumptions.
