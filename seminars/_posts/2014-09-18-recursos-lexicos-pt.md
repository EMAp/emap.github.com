Lexical resources are essential for the development of Natural
Language Processing and all the applications that come from it,
Information Retrieval, Information Extraction, Summarization, Question
Answering, Sentiment Analysis, Conversational Assistants, etc.. Even
for English, the most analyzed language, there are still some missing
resources, the existing lexica are not inter-related and information
that could, in principle, be obtained from pooling resources together
is not readily available. The situation is much worse for Portuguese,
where we lack big projects that accumulated resources such as WordNet,
COMLEX, VerbNet, the Penn TreeBank, FrameNet, GATE, NLTK, MindNet,
Delph-IN, ParGram, GF, etc. Together with colleages I've embarked in a
long-term project of building lexical resources for Portuguese and
making them open, so that others can build on them. Our basic strategy
is to do as much as we can automatically, but to try to verify the
automatically created data, to the best of our abilities. I will
describe the tools we created and the ones we are working on and why.

## Palestrantes

Valeria de Paiva is a mathematician, logician and computer scientist
based in Sunnyvale, CA. She works as Senior Research Scientist at
Nuance Communications in the Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning
group, using logic to improve communication with computer
systems. Before that she was a research scientist at the Intelligent
Systems Laboratory of PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), CA for many
years (2000-2008) and a search analyst at Cuil, Inc. and at Rearden
Commerce, now Deem. She received her PhD in Mathematics from Cambridge
University for work on "Dialectica Categories", and has ever since
worked on logical approaches to computation. She is on the editorial
boards of "Theoria and Application of Categories", "Logical Methods in
Computer Science" and of "Logica Universalis", as well as in the
editorial board of the Springer series of books "Logic, Language and
Information". She's an Honorary Research Fellow at the School of
Computer Science, University of Birmingham, UK, where she was an
Assistant Professor, and she taught recently at Stanford University
and Santa Clara University in California.
