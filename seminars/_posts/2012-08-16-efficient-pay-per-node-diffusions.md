Diffusion processes crawl networks visiting nodes through their
edges. There are a number of different types of network diffusions
(and models). Viruses and Web crawlers are just two types of such
diffusions. The social network - the graph of relationships and
interactions within a group of individuals - plays a fundamental role
as a medium for the spread of information, ideas, and influence among
its members. An important type of diffusion, which we call
pay-per-node diffusion, has received little attention in the
literature. In pay-per-node diffusions, visiting a node has a fixed
cost but accessing the list of neighbors comes for free with the node
visit. To illustrate, consider the following example. Facebook
marketeers rely on "word-of-mouth" advertisement to reach their
costumers, also known as viral marketing campaigns. For an ad to reach
all friends of a given Facebook user, this user must post the ad on
his or her Facebook wall for his or her friends to see. The ad gives
incentives (discounts) to new users for placing similar ads on their
walls, thus luring users to spread ad campaign like an epidemic. The
campaign goal is to reach the most number of users (paid users and
their friends) constrained to a fixed budget (maximum number of paid
users).  In this talk I present a first look at pay-per-node
diffusions on finite graphs. First we see that finite graph effects
must not be ignored, even for large graphs (e.g., Facebook). Focusing
our interest on flat-priced pay-per-node diffusions, where the price
of enrolling a node in the diffusion is the same for all nodes, we
study the efficacy of well known diffusions in the pay-per-node
setting and uncover key factors that make them efficient.
