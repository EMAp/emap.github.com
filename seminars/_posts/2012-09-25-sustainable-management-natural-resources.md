We cover applications of control theory and optimization to the
management of natural resources. To begin with, we present some
stylized decision models in climate change mitigation, fisheries
management, dam management.  We show how a priori conflicting
objectives such as economic (production) versus ecological
(preservation) can be formulated as constraints to be satisfied by a
control dynamical system.  Viability analysis provides conditions
under which there exist management strategies which allow these
constraints to be satisfied, on a given horizon. As an application, we
present a viability analysis of the anchovy--hake couple in the
Peruvian upwelling ecosystem.  We also develop a notion of ecosystem
sustainable yields.  When uncertainties affect the dynamics, we show
how to adapt the above framework and we introduce stochastic
viability. We propose to rank strategies by their probability to
achieve given objectives for all times on a given horizon. A numerical
application to dam management under tourist constraint is given.
