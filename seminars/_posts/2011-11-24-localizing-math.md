O seminário foi uma palestra do workshop
[Logics and Ontologies for Portuguese](/events/nlp-2011/).

We start from the analysis of Turing's work in On computable numbers,
with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem raising evidences
about how he proceeded to build the definition of
computability. Taking advantage of his stepwise construction that
starts from the materialities to achieve a satisfactory level of
abstraction, we show how his way of doing mathematic fits an approach
of knowledge construction where there is not definite separation
between materia and form, and thus, the world and the language are not
closed spheres. In the same line of reasoning, the abstract and the
concrete, the deduction and the induction, the technical and the
social, the objective and the subjective are unthinkable as pure
entities. Considering controversies and discussions from the
mid-nineteenth century to nowadays, we verify a social component that
permanently takes part in what is usually considered "technical
content" or “objectivity” undermining, thus, the axis of authority of
mathematics, logic and computing. Under this view new possibilities
for knowledge construction are acknowledged, allowing maths that are
done and lived outside the major centers.
