R&D races typically involve the development of several intermediate
steps and in some industries information about the competitor’s
development stage is strategic. This paper deﬁnes and shows the
existence of equilibrium for the incomplete information multistage R&D
race model where ﬁrms need to complete a ﬁnite number of intermediate
steps before the product or project is ﬁnished. In our model, there is
incomplete information because ﬁrms may not know the competitor’s
development stage during the race. By using numerical methods, we
study the equilibrium of this race in pure Markov strategies. We show
how the race duration, consumer surplus, ﬁrm value and total welfare
vary with investment costs, market size and intensity of competition
in the products market. We are able to assess the impact of a strong
patent regime in terms of consumer surplus, ﬁrm value and total
welfare.
