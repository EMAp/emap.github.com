Study of integration of flexibility and robustness to optimization
methods. Resumo: Resolution of difficult problems of optimization
become more and more effective. However, to reach this effectiveness,
the techniques are often very dedicated to an application. There are
thus very effective methods of resolution but when an evolution of the
problem occur, for instance addition or modification of a constraint,
these methods become much less powerful or even unusable. Our goal is
to evaluate how possible it is to develop algorithms able to deal with
problems subjected to very heterogeneous constraints, moving in the
time, without loss of performance. The study is applied to a problem
of communication networks design. We present the results and analyses
of the experiments carried out on the target problem. In particular,
we evaluate if the suggested architecture allows to treat different
versions from a basic problem, subjected to heterogeneous constraints
whose characteristics are not known at the beginning.
