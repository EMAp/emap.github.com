## Date and Location
 
September 26th and October 03, 10, 17, 24 (every friday), from 3 PM to
6PM.

Praia de Botafogo, 190, Rio de Janeiro. Room 1332. 

## Speakers

[Margaret Armstrong](http://goo.gl/39cMX0) and
[Alain Galli](http://goo.gl/f8KJzd) started the Quantitative Finance
Group at the École des Mines de Paris in 2001. The group trains French
engineers who want to be quants, traders & structurers in banks. The
group’s research focuses on:

- Modeling commodities (electricity, oil and gas, CO2 etc).
- Modeling the structure of electricity markets, and the impact of the
  introduction of renewables (wind power) and electric vehicles on
  day-ahead electricity prices.
- Evaluating and optimising of projects such as mines, oil fields and
  power plants that are subject to technical and financial
  uncertainty.
- Modelling the term structure of interest rates.
- Stochastic volatility models.
- Dynamic hedging of physical commitments.
- Copulas, especially Archimedean copulas.

Margaret Armstrong is a professor at the Cerna, Mines-Paristech. She
has a masters in mathematical statistics from the University of
Queensland, Australia, and a PhD in geostatistics from the École des
Mines de Paris.

Alain GALLI is a professor at the Cerna, Mines-Paristech. He holds a
PhD in mathematics from the University of Grenoble, France.
